# Senior-Capstone-Project
I researched the use of different machine learning algorithms and python to predict the outcome of soccer games in the English Premier League. This was my Capstone Project at the end of my Senior Year as a Goucher College Computer Science Major. My created most of the metrics I used in my prediction of oucomes of games, with data from whoscored.com. My best performing algorithms were the Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Regressor (they tied at an accuracy of 68%). This was impressive, considering that I only had 357 Data points (including only 108 validation test set data points)!

## FILES:
## MyCapstone.ipynb:
This file is a jupyter notebook that contains all the code I used in data processing, data analysis and machine Learning modeling.

## Table4.csv
This is a csv file containing the data based on data from whoscored.com, that I processed and used to perform my predictions.
