# Senior-Capstone-Project
I researched the use of different machine learning algorithms and python to predict the outcome of soccer games in the English Premier League. This was my Capstone Project at the end of my Senior Year as a Goucher College Computer Science Major. My created most of the metrics I used in my prediction of oucomes of games, with data from whoscored.com. My best performing algorithm was the Deep learning Model, which gave me an accuracy of ~ 71.60%. This was impressive, considering that I only had 357 Data points!
